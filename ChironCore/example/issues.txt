1. loop should have expression rather than just value
2. condition should be true for non zero values and not just true/false
3. class currently should have at least one member or python dynamic class initiation throw indentation error
4. Setting objects to N0ne in declaration is not done yet
5. instruction_list can contain both function declaration and classDeclaration this can cause problems
6. Multiple class inheritance is not yet supported! [fixed]
7. return is compulsory in function declaration with at least one return value
8. Solution to Avoid Unexpected Changes in Mutable Class Variables: use __init__ method during class declaration [fixed]
9. Writing self is compulsory in methods of class parameters
10. class must have at least one assignment statement [fixed]
11. Function overloading with number of arguments [fixed]
12. print the CHA 
13. Regular variables can also start with __ !!
14. Raise error when the normal function name start with __. semantic analysis. allow only private method in classes
15. :self can only come in the first position in the object access of method call chain
16. commenting now supported [fixed]
17. first all the declaration will be processed and then the instructions!
18. Strictly enforce the keywords like return and def to not be used as function of class names
19. There should be at least one instruction apart from function and class definitions in the program
